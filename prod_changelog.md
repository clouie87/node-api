###### #25 - Release Notes

###### Changes
 

- we’re going to tell the tagManager the server_name and tag that was just created (new_tag) 

- given the server_name and new_tag the tagManager will find the merged pull requests between the last tag with the server_name and new_tag 

- it will parse and create the change log from merged pull requests text 

- then updates the release notes on github with the changes that have been made, and the verification data (which allows us to find the server_name in the future)
